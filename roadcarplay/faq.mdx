    <Accordion title="My Music app says the Music Server is offline" icon="music">
        <Warning>The Music Server requires a valid **Tebex Transaction ID** to authenticate your purchase.</Warning>

        **Solution:**
        1. Open `API.lua` in your RoadCarPlay resource
        2. Enter your **TebexTransactionID** in the designated field
        3. Restart the resource

        **Where to find your Transaction ID:**
        - Check your purchase confirmation email from Tebex
        - Or log in to view your payment history:

        <Card title="Tebex Payment History" href="https://checkout.tebex.io/payment-history/login" icon="receipt" iconType="solid">
            View and retrieve your transaction ID from past purchases

    <Accordion title="I don't hear music in the Music app" icon="music">
        <Tip>Make sure you're using our **xSound** version and start **xSound before RoadPad**.</Tip>

        **Checklist**
        - Clear your client cache.
        - Check that **GTA music** is turned on.
        - Verify your **Windows volume mixer** isn't at 0% (this is independent of FiveM).

        <Warning>If your loading screen uses **YouTube** and you muted it there, the sound is muted everywhere. Unmute the loading screen.</Warning>
