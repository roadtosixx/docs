## Important Notes

<Note>
  The Customer-Dev role allows the assigned developer to:
  - Access support channels on your behalf
  - Create and respond to support tickets
  - View customer-specific resources
</Note>

<Tip>
  If you need to change your developer, simply use `/add-dev` with the new user. This will automatically replace the previous developer.
