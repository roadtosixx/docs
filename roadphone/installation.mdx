  **Important: File Upload Method**

  Never use FileZilla! It can corrupt or skip hidden files during upload.

  We strongly recommend using **WinSCP** for file transfers.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Resource Folder">
    Create a folder named `[phone]` inside your server's `resources` directory.

    Extract all scripts from the download into the `[phone]` folder.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Import Database">
    Import the `roadphone.sql` file into your database.

    <Warning>
      If you don't import the SQL file, you will see a `/fixphone` message in-game.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure API Keys">
    Open `API.lua` and enter your **Fivemanage** or **Fivemerr** API key.

    <Error>
      The script will not work without a valid API key.
    </Error>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Voice Chat">
    Edit `roadphone/config.lua` to set up your voice chat system.

    <Warning>
      If you don't configure voice chat in config.lua, calling and radio features will not work.
    </Warning>

    **Optional**: Add Discord webhooks in `API.lua` for logging.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Server Config">
    Open `server.cfg` and add these lines **after** your framework (`es_extended`, `qb-core`, or `qbox`):

    ```cfg
    ensure xsound
    ensure roadphone
    ```

    <Info>
      The load order is important. Always load the phone after your core framework and dependencies.
