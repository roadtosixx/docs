## Known Call Ending Issues

<Warning>
  SaltyChat has known issues when ending phone calls that have existed since the Lua version was released. These errors are not caused by RoadPhone.
</Warning>

### Common Problems

When ending a phone call while using SaltyChat, you may experience:

- Voice chat errors in the console
- Players remaining in the wrong voice channel
- Voice range not resetting properly
- Temporary voice communication issues

<Note>
  These issues persist in SaltyChat and have not been addressed by their development team despite being long-standing problems.
</Note>
